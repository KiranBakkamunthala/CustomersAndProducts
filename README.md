1. Introduction
Project Overview: This project is designed to manage Customers and Products.
Technologies Used: The stack includes JDK 17, Spring Boot 3.1.6, H2 database, exception handling, Lombok, DevTools, Swagger for API documentation, Redis for caching, 
Kafka for event-driven features, and GitHub for version control and CI/CD.

2. Architecture and Design
High-Level Architecture: Provide a diagram showing the overall system architecture, including the database, caching layer, messaging/event layer, and other components.
Key Components: Explain the core components, such as Spring MVC, services, controllers, and repositories.
Database Schema: Include a diagram of the Customers and Products tables and describe the relationships between them.

3. API Overview
API Endpoints: Outline the RESTful endpoints (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) for managing Customers and Products.
Swagger Integration: Demonstrate Swagger UI and show how it documents the API, including the available endpoints and request/response structure.

4. Live Demonstration
I would like to give presentation, 
CRUD Operations: Demonstrate how to add, update, retrieve, and delete Customers and Products.
Swagger UI: Show how to interact with the API using Swagger UI.
Error Handling: Highlight how errors are handled gracefully, ensuring a good user experience.

5. Key Features
Caching with Redis: Caching improves performance and helps reduce database load by storing frequently accessed data.
Event-Driven Features with Kafka: Describe how Kafka is used for event-driven communication, enabling asynchronous processing.
Proper Logging: Present the logback configuration and explain how request/response logs are captured to improve debugging and monitoring.

6. Code Walkthrough
Annotations: Explain the use of key Spring annotations like @RestController, @Service, and @Repository.
Controller & Service Layer: Walk through the controller and service layers, emphasizing the importance of separation of concerns.
Unit Tests & GitHub Actions: Describe the unit tests written using JUnit and Mockito, and demonstrate how GitHub Actions are configured for CI/CD.

7. Lessons Learned & Challenges
Challenges Faced: Discuss challenges faced during the implementation of new features, such as integrating Redis for caching, using Kafka for messaging, or setting up Swagger for API documentation.
8. Conclusion
 I plan to migrate the current monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture, which would enhance scalability, flexibility, and modularity. Additionally,
 I intend to implement enhanced security measures, such as advanced authentication mechanisms and better data encryption, to improve overall system security.
 
Note:  Before starting the Spring Boot application, ensure that the Zookeeper server and Kafka server are running for Kafka events, and start the Redis server and clear the cache for Redis caching.
